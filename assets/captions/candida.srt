1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,000
I sit across from
 people all day, every day who feel like

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,400
there's something wrong with them
 because they don't have a partner.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,240
We get Fed stories through pop culture

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
that are just the prologue to love, right?
 it's just finding someone.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,200
So many people sit across from me 

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,800
and say they've never been
 in a long term relationship.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,640
And yet when I dig a little deeper,
 of course, they have these lifelong

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,480
friendships or mentorships or coaching
 relationships that are just as valuable

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
and just as important.
 But there's no representation.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,560
When I was in my 20s 

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,360
and I went into therapy
 for the first time, 

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,400
I had all of these feelings
 from my therapist.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,040
And I was also in grad school
 to be a therapist

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,800
and had never really heard of this. 

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,080
And so I was thinking about her
 all the time, and I felt

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,960
a little bit obsessed.
 And then I felt really ashamed.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
And maybe 10 years ago,
 I started to go on Reddit.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
And every day there's like five,
 six, seven posts

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,880
about people who are horrified
 and mortified that they have

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,440
so many feelings for this person
 that they're paying to talk to.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
So I got really curious about that
 and what I realized is that

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,240
part of what creates shame around
 having these intense feelings

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,720
is that we don't have
 a frame of reference. 

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,320
So that's what led me to think of the term 

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,360
platonic intimacy and to start
 looking at other relationships.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
The younger people
 are so much more open to

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
what I think are the exciting new ways
 we're looking at relationships.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,800
I think that younger people
 today are have more hope

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,680
than any other generation in my lifetime
 that I've been in relationship to.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,600
And we have an opportunity
 to teach them that there are

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,280
so many kinds of love in the world
 instead of having them

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,120
go down the same path of looking for that
 one person, which is also great,

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
but not the only option.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm doing great, I'm a relational trauma
 therapist in Vancouver.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Welcome to 10X as you.
