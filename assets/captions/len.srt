1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,640
True reconciliation
 in Canada really is about learning.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,840
And let's be transparent,
 let's be honest, a lot of the history

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,040
that we are exposed to within
 this country is kind of hided.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,000
I think that as Canadian citizens,
 we've all heard the R word reconciliation,

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,400
but never do we ever really have the time
 or the opportunity

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,680
to unpack what that really mean.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,920
A pivotal moment in my life

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,560
was delivering a presentation on culture

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,720
safety, in humility and talking
 about the atrocities of our past.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,720
To a group of professionals. 

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,840
And at the very end of that presentation,
 one of the participants

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,040
had raised their hand
 and wanted to offer a comment.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,640
And she said, I am a newcomer to Canada.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,800
And when I arrived in this country, 

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,000
I was fleeing, you know, oppression
 in my own home country.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,520
And when I arrived here, you know,
 I didn't know anything

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,680
about indigenous people.
 And I still don't know very much.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,960
But this conversation
 has transformed forever, the way I look

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
at indigenous relations in this country.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,680
That was changing
 and defining moment in my life

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,720
and in my career
 on just how important these conversations

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,800
are that we as Canadians
 and we as human beings feel much better

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,360
when we know what I've learned over
 the years of talking about reconciliation

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,920
for a living has equipped me
 with a knowledge

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,240
and a profound understanding
 that this work really

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
is about relationship building,
 about learning about one another.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,320
In that aha moment that I had,
 I thought of no place else

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,040
better than the prestigious
 platform of a TED.

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,680
Talk to share this knowledge
 and share this information.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,880
Hi, my name is Limpia. 

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,080
I am Cosulich from CTSI First Nation. 

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,680
And welcome to Ted ZAPU.
